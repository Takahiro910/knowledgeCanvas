# **App Name**: Knowledge Canvas

## Core Features:

- File Upload & Node Creation: Upload files (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and display them as nodes on the canvas.
- Manual Note Creation: Create text-based notes directly on the canvas.
- Visual Node Linking: Link nodes together visually, establishing relationships between them.
- Dynamic Contextual Search: Search the canvas for nodes containing the search text. Display linked nodes up to a user-defined depth, using a slider to adjust the depth.
- Shared Canvas View: Enable shared read-only access to the canvas for team collaboration.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082) to convey intelligence, focus, and depth.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that allows the content to stand out.
- Accent color: Violet (#8A2BE2), a brighter version of indigo, is used to highlight interactive elements, creating contrast and guiding the user's attention.
- Clean and modern font that is easy to read at various sizes, suitable for both headings and body text within nodes.
- Simple, intuitive icons to represent file types (e.g., PDF, DOCX) and actions (e.g., linking, searching).
- A flexible and zoomable canvas that allows users to arrange nodes freely.
